# SolarKAT
MeerKAT as a solar telescope.  

Radio frequency interference is a growing problem in radio astronomy, especially for new-generation telescopes such as MeerKAT. Its wide field of view and high sensitivity make the MeerKAT telescope capable of capturing the Sun even when looking far away from it (close to 90 degrees). This ability facilitates also contamination from the out-of-field Sun causing in some conditions data corruption (which we call solar radio interference). SolarKAT is a solar imaging pipeline that aims to mitigate solar interference in MeerKAT data.
